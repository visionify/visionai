# **Dust Monitoring**

> Ensure effective dust detection in workplaces to enable air quality management and regulatory compliance.

## Overview

Dust monitoring and detection is an important task in a variety of applications, such as air quality monitoring, industrial hygiene, and public health. Monitoring also helps to demonstrate compliance with relevant regulations. COSHH is the law that requires employers to control substances that are hazardous to health. According to the Health & Safety Executive (HSE), employers can prevent or reduce workersâ€™ exposure to hazardous substances by finding out what the health hazards are; by deciding how to prevent harm to health; by providing effective control measures; by providing information and training; by providing monitoring and health surveillance, and by planning for emergencies.

In order to evaluate workplace safety, monitoring data is compared with Workplace Exposure levels (WELs) which prescribe the maximum exposure level to a hazardous substance over a set period of time. Failure to comply with COSHH and WELs can result in financial penalties, prosecutions and civil claims.

## VisionAI Based Monitoring

Our VisionAI based model is a useful tool for detecting and measuring dust levels, as it can analyze large amounts of data and identify patterns that may be difficult for humans to detect. To detect and measure dust levels, we have used a training dataset of images or sensor data with known dust levels. The images were captured with a camera or a microscope, and the sensor data was collected using a dust monitoring device. Our algorithm is then trained on this dataset to learn to recognize patterns in the images or sensor data that are associated with specific dust levels. 
Our model can be used for air quality monitoring applicationl; The algorithm is used to identify areas with high levels of dust and alert authorities or residents to take corrective actions. In an industrial hygiene application, the algorithm can be used to monitor workers' exposure to dust and ensure compliance with occupational health and safety regulations.
