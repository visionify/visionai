# **Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) Monitoring**

> Protect workers from harmful exposures and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.

## Overview

Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are chemicals that have a high vapor pressure at room temperature, meaning they can easily evaporate and enter the air. They are commonly found in various products, including paints, coatings, adhesives, solvents, and cleaning agents, among others. When these products are used or stored in workplaces, they can emit VOCs into the air, which can have harmful effects on human health and the environment.

Therefore, monitoring VOCs in the workplace is essential to ensure that the levels of these chemicals remain within safe limits. Excessive exposure to VOCs can cause a range of health problems, including irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, nausea, dizziness, and even long-term health effects such as cancer.

A VOCs monitoring model can provide accurate and continuous measurements of the levels of these chemicals in the air. This information can be used to identify potential sources of VOC emissions, evaluate the effectiveness of control measures, and determine whether additional measures are needed to ensure the safety of workers and the environment.

## VisionAI Based Monitoring:

Vision AI-based model monitoring used for tracing VOCs, can be particularly useful for detection in indoor or outdoor environment. In addition, our models integrated with advanced sensors can sense VOCs limit if exceeding in the surrounding air as soon as their percentage level increases or falls below a threshold value. 
Our algorithms can learn to recognize patterns in the data that are associated with specific VOCs and can then be used to predict the presence of these compounds in the indoor environment.
Similarly, for outdoor VOC detection, our algorithms are trained on data from air quality monitoring stations or even from satellite imagery. These algorithms can learn to identify patterns that are associated with specific sources of VOC emissions, such as traffic or industrial facilities, and can then be used to trace the origins of these compounds.

## Model

We would be releasing the model for VOCs exceed limit detection in *Q2-2023*.
