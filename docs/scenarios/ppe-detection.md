## Overview

Prevent Workplace Injuries and Occupational Hazards with Vision AI. Failure to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) is a major cause of injuries from accidents in factories and other work environments. It is the responsibility of employers to provide their employees with adequate personal protective equipments (PPE) and to ensure that all individuals comply with the company policies for wearing PPE. Though providing the safety gear itself might not seem difficult, ensuring that every individual is consistently following these rules is challenging.

A lapse in the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), even for a short duration, can result in a workplace accident. A computer vision based continuous PPE monitoring solution can help with increasing compliance.

## Why PPE compliance is **necessary**

- Accidents and injuries that take place due to an employee not wearing PPE holds business owners/employers accountable legally

- Injuries and accidents that result from not wearing PPE results in lost time, reduced productivity, costly worker compensations, etc.
- According to OSHA, the proper use of PPE can prevent 37.6% of occupational injuries and diseases.
- 12%–14% of occupational injuries resulting in total disability are caused by employees not wearing appropriate PPE
- Workplace Fatalities are on the rise and employers cannot afford to tolerate PPE negligence. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were 5,190 fatal work injuries recorded in the United States in 2021, an 8.9-percent increase from 4,764
- Speaking about one of the most injury-susceptible body parts - hands, OSHA reports that almost 70 percent of hand and arm injuries could be prevented with personal protective equipment, specifically safety gloves. Yet, 70 percent of workers don’t wear hand - protection, and of those who do, 30 percent don’t wear the right kind of glove for the task.
- If we consider one of the leading causes for workplace fatalities - Head Injuries a study by BLO found out that 84% of head injuries at a worksite were due to absence of safety helmets. A percentage which not small considering there were 68,170 head injuries in 2021

## Technical challenges faced by PPE Detection systems in the market

#### Low Accuracy

When it comes to PPE detection systems that work with visual inputs, accuracy is a major issue in the industry. This is due to variations in lighting, background, and the appearance of PPE itself (e.g., different colors and styles).

#### Speed

Creating optimum Real-time processing systems that are cost-effective is major challenge.

#### High rates of False positives and False Negatives

Minimizing false-positives and false negatives in such systems is another challenge faced by the industry. Errors and inaccurate detections can have serious consequences for a workplace.

#### Scalability

Be it cost-effectiveness, managing occlusions/poor image quality or covering all segments of a workplace, proper scalability of a computer Vision system to detect PPE in real-time is not feasible for many solutions providers.

## Our Key differentiators/USP

#### Unmatched accuracy

Trained and Tested to give the best results. Our systems are trained to detect PPE with an accuracy of 99%. Additionally, our system minimizes false-positives or false-negatives.

#### Lightning Fast and Response Time

Our Ultra-fast Processing provides real-time inference results and feedback (~30 frames per second processing). You can also go for customizable telemetry and inference results based on your requirements.

#### Scalability and Instant Deployment

Our pre-trained/custom models can be deployed instantly and are camera independent which means they can be pre-installed with existing cameras on site. We also offer cameras, IoT sensors and edge devices with strategic placement that helps scale a large workplace area with minimum installations. Further, our models are optimized to run on the low-cost computer and camera chipsets.

#### Custom Integrations

With room for plenty of customization based on your use-case, we can create smart dashboards, alert/notification based systems that corrects an individual in real-time. We provide web-hooks, APIs, MQQT messages for integrations with different types of integrations. Whether you are looking for a simple dashboard, or integrations with your ERP system - we have experience in building robust integrations.

#### Pre-Processing and Privacy by design

Our PRe-processing enhances Image quality and resolution before further analysis is run on it. Our models’ pre-processing ensures data privacy is maintained by blurring out faces and other sensitive information present in a frame.
