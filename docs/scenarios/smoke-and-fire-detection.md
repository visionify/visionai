## Overview 

Fire can be one of the most catastrophic disasters that can happen anywhere and cause major destruction. Fire hazards exist in all types of industrial buildings and business environments. Fire incident in the workplace not only accounts for a large number of injuries but also for downtime and running costs to repair the damage to the premises and machinery. 

Conventional heat detector-based fire warning systems cannot detect an early fire. Heat detectors only alert when the temperature of the surrounding environment reaches a certain level, and it doesnâ€™t happen until fire spreads considerably, not leaving many opportunities to avoid the incident. Therefore, it is important to have an early fire signs detection method that would allow authorities to detect and put out fires before it goes out of control.  

To monitor and detect early signs of fire at workplaces, cameras can be used. 

## Vision AI-based monitoring 

Vision AI-based Model for Early Fire Signs Detection is designed to spot early signs of smoke and fire and helps save lives and mitigate damages caused by industry fires. We aim to create safe workplaces by offering innovative, reliable, flexible, and scalable solutions. 

To ensure accuracy and reliability, these camera-based monitoring services should be supplemented by effective practices to ensure and prevent fire hazards. Furthermore, workers working in different factory units should always be made aware of fire signs to look for. 


## Camera Configuration


### Camera Placement
- Install cameras near areas where fires are most likely to occur, such as kitchens, electrical rooms, and mechanical rooms.
- Place cameras in areas with high ceilings to capture smoke and heat rising towards the ceiling.

### Camera Height

- Cameras should be installed at a height of 10-12 feet above the floor level.

- Place the camera 20-25 feet from the focal point.


### Camera Angle Mounting Ranges

- Place the camera at a downward angle of 45-60 degrees to capture footage of the floor surface and up towards the ceiling to capture smoke and heat rising.

## Model Details 

### Dataset 

The dataset for this scenario is based on early fire detection algorithms that are currently in practice.  

The dataset is made up of images and videos gathered from varied sources. The dataset has been designed to ensure real-world situations. It has an even distribution of: 


- Different(indoor/outdoor) environments 
- Variations in foregroung objects including persons, equipments etc 
- Different lighting conditions
- Variations in weather conditions 
- Using security camera feeds 
- Multiple instances of fire and smoke 
- Variations in camera orientations 
- Classes considered for model building are smoke and fire

Total number of images used was 63,055


### Model 

The model is based off of the YOLOv5 algorithm. The model is trained on a custom dataset of images and videos. The model is trained based on the above dataset compiled by our team. We intend to develop a model that generalizes well in real world situations. 

The model recorded the following performance metrics:

<div class="main"><div class="bar"><h4>Precision <i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></h4><div role="progressbar" style="--value:58"></div></div><div class="bar"><h4>Recall <i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></h4><div role="progressbar1" style="--value:83"></div></div><div class="bar"><h4>mAP <i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></h4><div role="progressbar2" style="--value:78"></div></div></div>


The model is adaptable enough to run on any edge computing device.


### Scenario details

The business logic for this scenario is as follows: 

- We use existing camera feeds from the premises to monitor the early signs of fire in the workplace to ensure the safety of human lives in the workplace. 
- VisionAI system is able to run on edge devices. It uses camera feeds for processing. 
- We detect the presence of smoke and fire in the camera feed. 
- An alarming system is inplace as part of early fire signs detection solution.
