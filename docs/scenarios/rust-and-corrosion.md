 Visual inspection of industrial environments is a common requirement across heavy industries, such as transportation, construction, and shipbuilding, and typically requires qualified experts to perform the inspection. Inspection locations can often be remote or in adverse environments that put humans at risk, such as bridges, skyscrapers, and offshore oil rigs.Many of these industries deal with huge metal surfaces and harsh environments. A common problem across these industries is metal corrosion and rust. Although corrosion and rust are used interchangeably across different industries (we also use the terms interchangeably in this post), these two phenomena are different.Visionify’s AI Vision Model for Rust/Corrosion Detection is designed to detect instances of rust/corrosion if any in machine parts , manufacturing equipments etc.

## Dataset

We combined data from multiple sources and prepared a dataset by considering intricacies of real-world situations. Our combined dataset truly reflects the presence of rust/corrosion over different parts used to assess workplace safety.

Class considered for model building is the rust. Model  is trained for 5572 images.


## Model details

Yolov5s is used for object detection modeling and following performance metrics are recorded:


### Scenario details

## Training with custom data

The scenario is provided as part of our GPL-v3 Open-Source package for VisionAI. If you wish to train this with custom datasets, please contact us and we can provide you with the training code. You can do custom training with your own datasets for free, as long as it complies with GPLv3 license (you give back the code to the community). If you are interested in a custom license, please (contact us)[contact.md].
