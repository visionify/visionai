# **Mobile Phone Usage Detection** 

> Enabling businesses to overcome digital distractions and misuse of mobile phones at workplaces.

Mobile phones at workplaces are proving to be an insidious way to execute malicious purposes. Prevent industrial espionage and reinforce security measures with the most reliable mobile phone usage detection models powered by AI and Deep Learning. 
Visionify's computer vision solutions are more accurate than the conventional methods, can safely detect mobile phone usage (people taking pictures, recording videos/audios, sending texts in prohibited areas). We offer instant integration with your existing camera infrastructure, and quick results. 


## Vision AI based monitoring


Vision AI-based system can be used to detect mobile phone usage by providing real-time video feeds at workplaces. This system can be used to detect an event of workers using mobile phones aganist compliance policies.


Enforce any company policies on mobile-usage in the workplace.
These camera based detection processes should be supplimented by strong compliance practices. If workers are prohibited from mobile usage, ensure that they are aware of the policy and the consequences of violating it. So, if an employee is found to be using mobile phone, an appropriate action needs to be taken.


## Model Details

### Dataset
Model training is carried out with Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context dataset. Person class is considered for model building. 

Basically, COCO is a  large-scale dataset and it provides real-world data representation including:

- Indoor vs Outdoor environments
- Male vs Female
- Day vs Night
- Different types of clothing
- Different distances from the camera
- Various lighting conditions
- Various camera angles and resolutions
- Using seurity camera feeds


### Model
The model is built using Yolov5 pre-trained model for person and mobile classes. The yolov5 model is used to identify the human body landmarks of the subject. 

The Yolov5 model provides the following metrics:


|Acccuracy|	Recall	|mAP	|
|---------|---------|-------|
|84%  |85.12%    |81.51%  |

and landmark detection model gives the following metrics:

|Acccuracy|Recall	|Precision|
|---------|---------|-------|
|84%|72.8%|84.9%  |
The model is light-weight enough to be run on any edge devices.

### Scenario details

The business logic for this scenario is as follows:
- We use existing camera feeds from the premises to detect mobile phone usage by employees.
- VisionAI system is able to run on edge devices. It uses camera feeds for processing. 
- We detect the mobile phone usage event and an alert is raised.
