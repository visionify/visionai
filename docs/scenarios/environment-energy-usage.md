## Overview
Energy usage monitoring refers to the process of collecting and analyzing data on how energy is being used in buildings, facilities, and other settings. The purpose of energy usage monitoring is to identify opportunities for energy conservation and efficiency improvements, reduce energy waste and costs, and promote sustainability.


Overall, energy usage monitoring is an essential component of sustainable energy management, helping to reduce energy waste, lower costs, and promote a more sustainable future.

## Vision AI based monitoring

Vision AI based monitors can be used for the detection of energy usage monitoring events by providing real-time video feeds of the factory area. The cameras scan every frame and monitor the energy usage of machines and equipment in a factory and help identify inefficiencies, optimize processes, and reduce energy costs.

## Events

VisionAI model's generated events would be:

- Energy usage exceeds limit

It is recommended that any instance of energy level's exceeding should be reported. This is because it is a sign of inefficiency and can be used to optimize processes and reduce energy costs.

An event data for this may include the following information:


- Date and Time: The date and time when the event was detected.

- Location: The location where the event was detected.

- Device: The device where the event was detected.   

## Camera Configuration

To set up a camera system for energy usage monitoring,You will need a camera capable of capturing footage of your energy meter or other relevant devices that you want to monitor. 

### Camera Placement

- Install cameras near energy usage systems, such as HVAC, lighting, and electrical panels.
- Place cameras in areas where people tend to interact with the energy systems, such as control rooms, equipment rooms, and switch rooms.

### Camera Height

- Cameras should be installed at a height of 7-8 feet above the floor level.

- Place the camera 5-10 feet from the focal point.

### Camera Angle Mounting Ranges

- Place the camera at a level angle to capture footage of the energy systems and controls.

Find more details about camera placement [here](../overview/cameras.md).

  

## Model Details

### Dataset
The dataset for this scenario is based on real-world energy usage monitoring detection events.
The dataset consists of images and videos collected from various sources. 

### Model

The model to detect energy usage monitoring is in progress and it will be released soon.


### Scenario details

The business logic for this scenario is as follows:

- We use existing camera feeds from the premises for raising energy usage monitoring events.
- VisionAI system is able to run on edge devices. It uses camera feeds for processing.
- From the camera feed we identify inefficiencies, optimize processes, and reduce energy costs.
- If energy usage monitoring event is detected, an alert is raised.

=== "Test now with online Web-Cam"
     To test this model & scenario, you can use the following steps:
     
     - Install the visionai package from PyPI
     
        ```console
        $ pip install visionai
        
        ```
     
     - Test the scenario from your local web-cam
     

        ```console
        $ visionai scenario test energy-usage-monitoring-detection

        Downloading models for scenario: energy-usage-monitoring-detection
        

        Starting scenario: energy-usage-monitoring-detection..

        ```
    - You should be able to see the events generated on your console window with the detections of energy usage monitoring within the camera field of view.

=== "With RTSP Camera - Pipelines"
     [TODO]
 
=== "With Azure Setup"
     VisionAI app is available at a Azure Market place, one can download and use it by following steps mentioned [here](../overview/azure-managed-app.md)
