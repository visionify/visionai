# **Equipment temperature monitoring**

> Monitor environment temperature. Get an alert when temperature exceeds a limit or below a threshold.

## Overview 

Temperature is a key factor in the health and safety of people and property. It is important to monitor the temperature of the environment to ensure that it is within the acceptable range. Organizations need a sensor-based temperature monitoring device to ensure smooth equipment functioning, safe exits, and quick preventive maintenance. 

## IR camera based temperature monitoring 

Visionifyâ€™s thermal monitoring solution integrated with an IR camera monitors environment temperature and functioning under various conditions and surroundings. Our solution detects equipment temperature and performance by processing real-time images and videos from different sources. In addition, it can trigger an alarm (as soon as the temperature reaches the threshold margins or faulty equipment is detected) and identify areas where exits are present. 
    
## Events

VisionAI model's generated events would be:

- Temperature exceeds limit
- Temperature subceeds limit

## Model
We would be releasing the model for monitoring equipment noise levels in *Q2-2023*.
