## Overview

Measuring occupancy metrics is crucial for businesses because of the valuable insights it offers. Such insights help optimize various aspects of a business operation, from customer experiences and marketing strategies to operational efficiencies. By accurately measuring and analyzing occupancy metrics, businesses can make data-driven decisions to improve other aspects of their business, like optimizing the physical layout and resource management. While there are existing systems such as sensors, Wi-Fi devices, and Surveillance, they all exhibit lack of accuracy, and manual intervention.

## Vision AI based monitoring

Track workplace Occupancy Metrics effortlessly with Vision AI monitoring that provides real-time insights and analysis. Our ready-to-deploy model is designed to provide businesses and organizations with valuable insights such as:

- Occupancy count: This measures the number of people or objects within a given space, such as a room or a parking lot.

- Dwell time: This measures the amount of time that people spend in a particular location, such as a store or a workspace.

- Traffic flow: This tracks the movement of people or objects through a space, enabling businesses to optimize their layouts for maximum efficiency.

- Occupancy density: This measures the number of people or objects per unit of space, indicating whether a particular area is overcrowded or underutilized.

- Heatmaps: These visualizations show the most crowded areas in a building or a room, helping businesses to optimize their layouts and improve customer flow.

- Social distancing compliance: This monitors and enforces social distancing guidelines by identifying people who are too close to each other and triggering an alert.

- Foot traffic: This tracks the number of people entering and exiting a building, store, or event, providing insights into customer behavior and trends.

- Queue management: This analyzes the length of lines and identifies bottlenecks, optimizing customer flow and reducing wait times in places like retail stores and theme parks.

- Occupancy rate: This measures the percentage of space that is occupied at a given time, providing insights into space utilization and capacity planning.

- Crowd density: This measures the number of people per unit of space, providing insights into areas that may be overcrowded or unsafe.

- Occupancy behavior: This tracks how people move and interact within a space, providing insights into how spaces are being used and how they can be optimized.

- Occupancy trends: This analyzes occupancy data over time, identifying patterns and trends that can inform business decisions such as staffing, marketing, and capacity planning.

- Occupancy alerts: This triggers alerts when occupancy levels exceed predetermined thresholds, enabling businesses to take proactive measures to manage crowds and ensure safety.

## Model Details

### Dataset

The dataset consists of images and videos collected from diverse sources and is designed to reflect real-world scenarios. It is evenly distributed with:

- Images with different subjects: The dataset includes images of people or objects in a variety of positions and orientations within the space being monitored.
- Images with different lighting conditions: The dataset includes images captured in different lighting conditions, such as bright sunlight or dim lighting.
- Images captured at different times of the day: The dataset includes images captured at different times of day to capture the variations in occupancy patterns over time.
- Images with different camera angles: The dataset includes images captured from different camera angles, such as top-down, side-on, or at an angle.
- Images with different camera types: The dataset includes images captured with different camera resolutions and focal lengths to simulate real-world scenarios.
- Images with a variety of occlusions, such as people partially hidden behind obstacles or objects.
- Variation in subjects: The dataset includes images of people wearing different types of clothing, such as hats, coats, or backpacks.
- Images with different camera angles: The dataset includes images that are taken from different camera angles, such as top-down, side view, or angled view.
- Images with different environments: The dataset includes images that show different types of workspace infrastructures, environments and layout, such as standing desks, shared desks, or cubicles.

### Model

The model to track events of occupancy metrics is in progress and it will be released soon.

### Scenario and Potential Deployment Area Details

- Retail stores: Retail stores can use occupancy metrics to optimize store layouts, improve customer flow, and reduce wait times.

- Office buildings: Office buildings can use occupancy metrics to optimize workspace layouts, improve traffic flow, and identify underutilized areas.

- Transportation hubs: Transportation hubs, such as airports and train stations, can use occupancy metrics to optimize passenger flow, reduce wait times, and improve safety.

- Stadiums and event venues: Stadiums and event venues can use occupancy metrics to optimize seating arrangements, improve traffic flow, and enhance the overall visitor experience.

- Healthcare facilities: Healthcare facilities can use occupancy metrics to optimize waiting areas, improve patient flow, and ensure compliance with social distancing guidelines.

- Public spaces: Public spaces, such as parks and city centers, can use occupancy metrics to optimize traffic flow, identify overcrowding, and improve safety.

- Manufacturing plants: Manufacturing plants can use occupancy metrics to optimize production lines, improve traffic flow, and identify bottlenecks.

- Parking lots: Parking lots can use occupancy metrics to optimize parking arrangements, reduce wait times, and improve safety.


=== "Test now with online Web-Cam"
     To test this model & scenario, you can use the following steps:

     - Install the visionai package from PyPI
     
        ```console
        $ pip install visionai
        
        ```
     
     - Test the scenario from your local web-cam
     

        ```console
        $ visionai scenario test occupancy-metrics

        Downloading models for scenario: occupancy-metrics
        Model: occupancy-metrics: https://workplaceos.blob.core.windows.net/models/yolov5s-occupancy-metrics/yolov5s-occupancy-metrics-0.0.1.zip
        

        Starting scenario: occupancy-metrics..

        ```
    - You should be able to see the events generated on your console window with events of occupancy metrics within the camera field of view.

=== "With RTSP Camera - Pipelines"
