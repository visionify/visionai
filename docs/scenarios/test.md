## Run a **Scenario**

Use `visionai run` command to run a scenario. In its simplest sense, you can run a single scenario on your web-cam. In a more complex use-case, you can specify a pipeline of scenarios, configure notification logic for each scenario, timings for each scenario etc.

<div class="termy">

```console
$ visionai run --scenario early-smoke-and-fire-detection --camera OFFICE-01

Starting early-smoke-and-fire-detection
