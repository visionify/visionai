## Overview

Tools check in/out monitoring deals with monitoring the tools that employees use. It is important to ensure that all tools that employees use - go through a common checkout process. This is to ensure that the tools are not lost or stolen.  Event is raised when employees don't check-out the tool and carry them out.              
         

## Vision AI-based monitoring 

Vision AI-based model for monitoring is used to ensure that all tools that employees use - go through a common checkout process. Event is raised when employees don't check-out the tool and carry them out. Configuration is required to mark where the check-out counter is located.

We would be releasing the model for monitoring equipment noise levels in *Q2-2023*.
