## Overview

Some meters/sensors might be analog and it is difficult to replace those.
Instead we can install a camera in-front of it and then the camera will keep emitting periodic events with analog meters. A single camera can support multiple analog readings as long as that fits in its field of view.           

## Vision AI-based monitoring 

Vision AI-based model for monitoring analog dials using camera would be detecting the analog dials and generating periodic events. This can be used to monitor analog dials.



## Camera Configuration


### Camera Placement

- Install cameras near the analog dials that require monitoring.
- Place cameras in areas where there is sufficient lighting to capture the dial readings clearly.

### Camera Height

- Cameras should be installed at a height of 5-6 feet above the floor level.

- Place the camera 3-4 feet from the focal point.

### Camera Angle Mounting Ranges

- Place the camera at a level angle to capture footage of the analog dials.

Find more details about camera placement [here](../overview/cameras.md).


## Model
We would be releasing the model for monitoring equipment noise levels in *Q2-2023*.
