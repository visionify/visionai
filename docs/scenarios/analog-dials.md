## Overview

Some meters/sensors might be analog and it is difficult to replace those.
Instead we can install a camera in-front of it and then the camera will keep emitting periodic events with analog meters. A single camera can support multiple analog readings as long as that fits in its field of view.           

## Vision AI-based monitoring 

Vision AI-based model for monitoring analog dials using camera would be detecting the analog dials and generating periodic events. This can be used to monitor analog dials.



## Model
We would be releasing the model for monitoring equipment noise levels in *Q2-2023*.
