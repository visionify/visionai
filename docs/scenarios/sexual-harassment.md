# **Sexual Harassment**

> Create a safer and more respectful workplace for all employees

## Overview

Sexual harassment in the workplace is a serious issue that can have significant negative impacts on employees' mental health, job satisfaction, and overall well-being. In addition, it can also result in decreased productivity and increased turnover, leading to financial costs for the company.

Implementing a sexual harassment detection model can also send a clear message to employees that the organization takes sexual harassment seriously and is committed to creating a safe and respectful workplace for all. This can help to foster a culture of respect and trust within the organization, which can have positive impacts on employee morale and overall job satisfaction.

Overall, a sexual harassment detection model can help organizations to create a safer and more respectful workplace for all employees, which can lead to increased productivity, reduced turnover, and improved organizational outcomes.

## VisionAI Based Monitoring

Sexual harassment detection using VisionAI based solution can help to prevent inappropriate behavior and create safer environments. Our models can analyze video footage or images and identify patterns or actions that are indicative of sexual harassment.

To detect sexual harassment our model is trained on a dataset of video footage or images with labeled instances of sexual harassment. The algorithm can learn to recognize patterns in the data that are associated with inappropriate behavior, such as physical contact, gestures, or facial expressions.

Our trained model now, can be used to analyze live video footage or images in real-time which can further help in enabling alert to authorities or trigger an alarm when it detects suspicious behavior, allowing them to intervene and prevent further harassment.

## Model

We would be releasing the model for Sexual Harassment detection in *Q2-2023*.
