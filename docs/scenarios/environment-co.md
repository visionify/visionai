# **Carbon Monoxide(CO) Monitoring**

> Ensure detection and tracing of CO emissions, as it can analyze large amounts of data and identify patterns that may be difficult for humans to detect.


## Overview

Carbon monoxide is a poisonous, flammable gas that is colorless, odorless, tasteless, and slightly less dense than air. It can have serious health consequences when present in high concentrations in indoor and outdoor environments. 

Carbon monoxide is a combustion by-product. Popular home appliances, such as gas or oil furnaces, gas refrigerators, gas clothing dryers, gas ranges, gas water heaters or space heaters, fireplaces, charcoal grills, and wood burning stoves are made.

## VisionAI Based Monitoring:

VisionAI Based model are trained on sensor data from carbon monoxide detectors. 
For indoor CO detection, our models can learn to recognize patterns in the data that are associated with high levels of CO and can then be used to predict the presence of this gas in the indoor environment. Our solution can also be used to identify potential sources of CO emissions, such as malfunctioning appliances or blocked vents, and can alert users to take corrective actions.

Similarly, for outdoor CO detection, our models are trained on data from air quality monitoring stations or even from satellite imagery. Our system can learn to identify patterns that are associated with specific sources of CO emissions, such as traffic or industrial facilities, and can then be used to trace the origins of these emissions.
