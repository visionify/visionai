# **Perimeter Control/Fence Intruder Detection**

> 

## Overview

Perimeter protection is the first line in the defense to detect an intruder. For premise perimeter defence, doors, windows, vents, skylights, or any other opening to a building, are the most frequently used sensing points. The majority of alarm systems offer this level of security because more than 80% of break-ins take place through these openings. The primary benefit of perimeter security is its straightforward construction. The main drawback is that it just shields the apertures. 
<p>Constraint - Perimeter security is pointless if the intruder breaks through a wall, enters through the ventilation system, or hangs around after closing. </p>



## Vision AI based monitoring

Vision AI based perimeter control can be used to detect intruders in the premises. The model uses a detection algorithm followed by computer vision techniques to detect intruders in images and videos. The model works in a way that it ensures that intruders are fully and effectively detected so that neccesary action can be taken to  prevent unauthorized access. 



## Model
We would be releasing the model for perimeter control in *Q2-2023*.
