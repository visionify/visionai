# **Camera Placement Guide**

> Use your existing camera to integrate with VisionAI platform 

Proper camera placement is essential to ensure that all areas of the workplace are adequately covered.

## Camera Placement Guidelines

When positioning cameras for various use situations, take into account the following general guidelines: 


1. Lighting: Install cameras underneath a light fittings so that they do not obscure the cameras.

2. Backlighting: Avoid mounting cameras near to window or other areas to protect from backlighting issue. It affects image quality.

3. Local policies: Take into account local placement policies and laws.

4. Authorization: The installation of cameras should be authorized by a designated person or department within the organization. 

5. Maintenance: Cameras should be regularly maintained and checked to ensure they are functioning properly. The policy should specify who is responsible for maintaining the cameras and how often they should be checked.



!!! note
    Overall, it's important to develop local policies for camera mounting that balance the need for surveillance with the protection of privacy rights. The policies should be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure they remain relevant and effective.

## Camera View

The camera view refers to the field of vision captured by a camera. The camera view is determined by the placement of the camera and its angle of view.

There are two primary modes of camera placement that are considered for VisionAI workplace safety scenarios:

- Ceiling-mounted and 
- Straight-mounted.

### Ceiling-mounted cameras

- Ceiling-mounted cameras are typically installed on the ceiling or high up on a wall and are pointed downwards. They provide a wide-angle view of the area below.
- These cameras are ideal for monitoring larger areas, such as open workspaces, warehouses, or production floors, where a bird's eye view is necessary to capture all activities in the space.
- These cameras can also be used in areas where there are obstructions that would block the view of a straight-mounted camera.
- These cameras can cover larger areas with fewer cameras, making them cost-effective and efficient.

    The following illustration provides simulations for the camera ceiling views.

### Straight-mounted cameras
- Straight-mounted cameras are mounted at eye level or lower on a wall or a stand and are pointed straight ahead. They  provide more focused view of the area in front of them. 
- These cameras are ideal for monitoring smaller areas, such as corridors, entrances and exits,  where a more focused view is required for capturing specific activities. 
- These cameras are also useful for capturing facial features and other details as they are closer to the subject being monitored.
- One of the advantages of straight-mounted cameras is that they are often easier to install and adjust, and they allow for more detailed and accurate identification of individuals. 

    The following illustration provides simulations for the camera front views.

When determining which mode of camera placement to use, it's important to consider the specific needs of required use case. Factors such as the size of the area to be monitored, the level of detail required, and the presence of obstructions should all be taken into account to ensure that the cameras are installed in the most effective and efficient manner possible.
